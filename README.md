Overview
-------
This repository contains analysis of small molecule drug entries in XML version of DrugBank Database Version 4.5.0 (released on 2016.04.20)[1] to categorize predicted nanoparticle formation abilities according to the decision tree in publication above. SMILES, LogP, strongest acidic pKa and strongest basic pKa values were extracted from DrugBank DataBase. We created a new molecular property descriptor called Number of High Intrinsic State Substructures (NHISS). NHISS is calculated as the total number of functional groups in a molecule with fluorine (-F) and double bonded oxygen (=O) which have high instrinsic state values [2]. 

NHISS = fluorine + carbonyl + sulfinyl + 2 * sulfonyl + nitroso + 2 * nitro

Substructure search was performed for fluorine, carbonyl, nitro, nitroso, sulfinyl and sulfonyl functional groups on the SMILES strings of each DrugBank entry. Substructure search based on SMARTS was performed programmatically using OpenEYE OEChem Toolkit [3,4].

Steps of the analysis of drugs in DrugBank:

1. Downloading latest DrugBank Database (Released on Apr. 20th, 2016, XML format)  from http://www.drugbank.ca/releases/4-5-0/downloads/all-full-database and named drugbank_20160420.xml

2. Run IPython Notebook **get_descriptors_from_drugbank_xml.ipynb**  

    Dependencies of this notebook:  
    * OpenEye OEChem library, version 2.0.5, OpenEye Scientific Software, Inc., Santa Fe, NM, USA, www.eyesopen.com, 2010.  
    * Python scripts: count_carbonyls.py, count_fluorines.py, count_sulfinyls.py, count_sulfonyls.py, count_nitroso.py, count_nitro.py
 

3. Run IPython Notebook **drugbank_decision_tree.ipynb**  

    Output: df_drugbank_decision_tree.csv (Group column represents which group of decision tree each small molecule drug is categorized to.)
